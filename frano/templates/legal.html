              <strong>Copying</strong>
              You are allowed to freely fork our <a href="http://github.com/fxdemolisher/frano" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repo
              and start your own site. What we ask is you talk to us first in case there is some feature that we could implement
              that will make your life easier and not make you start a clone site.

              <strong>Your Information</strong>
              We will try our best to protect the information stored on this site from prying eyes, but the only  this we guarantee 
              is that whatever is entered is owned by you (not us) and will never be used for marketing purposed or any other
              evil purposed.

            <li>
              <strong>Security</strong>
              We believe very strongly in security by obscurity. There is generally no information to tie a user to their portfolio
              since you use special random links to access your data. Because of this we do not require a high level of security on 
              this site.
