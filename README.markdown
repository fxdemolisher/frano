What is Frano
=============

Frano is a simple transaction based portfolio web application.

It is also my first python/djano project.

For Users:
----------

It is easy to get started with. Visit frano, create a portfolio, enter all your transactions (or from a starting point) 
and start watching how your portfolio is doing. One outstanding feature that frano provides is calculating your [XIRR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return),
giving you a clear view of how your portfolio is doing over time.

For Developers:
---------------

Frano uses yahoo finance APIs to retrieve security prices and cache them in a local database. Most everything else
in this project is extremely basic python/django. 

Feel free to submit requests for features or patches.
